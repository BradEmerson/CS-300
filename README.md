What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The main problem I was solving in the projects for this course was determining which data structures were least, and most efficient for different applications.  In our case, we specifically looked at reading lines containing two to four variables each from a comma separated value file, and storing them in a data structure.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by determining the potential difference in time it would take given high-volume scaling, and weighing the benefits and drawbacks of each data structure.  Some, for instance, are harder to program at my level of expertise (novice) such as Hash Tables, whereas others are only marginally slower, but efficient in other ways, and are easier to program.  As my skills continue to grow with practice and experience throughout my career, I'm certain I'll reconsider each data structure as I write programs, and base my decisions less off of my own personal skill level, and more off of raw data efficiency (speed/memory usage).

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I put forth a VERY large amount of effort, and spent a great deal of time writing code until either it worked exactly how I wanted it to, or I exhausted every possible option to make my code my absolute best possible product.  I'm reminded each class that has coding that before I succeed at something, I'm going to fail a great deal, but the important thing is that I'm learning a great deal from my failures.  This class was no exception (for the record I currently have an "A" in this course, I'm speaking in terms of individual failures while programming).  

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

It's another tool in the toolbox, so to speak.  I had never even heard of Binary Search Trees or Hash Tables prior to this course.  It was very enlightening to see just how complicated data structures can actually be, and how customizeable they can be as well.  I'm certain I'll learn several more data structures, or variations thereof along the way.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I'm glad to be at the point where commenting my code is more intended for someone who can read code in the first place such that I don't have to comment every single line stating exactly what commonly used items are doing (e.g. explaining that "int" is an integer variable in a comment).  That being said, I learned more about how to compartmentalize my code in programs, and how to organize it so that it flows well, and is easy to read.  Compartmentalizing code helps a great deal with all 3 of these factors (maintainability, readability, and adaptability).
